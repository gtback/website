Isolation is principle by which interacting code is kept apart from other
interacting code.



## Subprinciples

* Encapsulation
* Avoiding 'leaky' abstractions
* Separation of concerns
* Loose coupling
* Global variables are bad
* "Functional is better"
* SOLID
* Unit testing is bad
* Low coupling
* High code cohesion
