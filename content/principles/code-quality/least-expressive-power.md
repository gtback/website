title: Write code with the least expressive power
---

Examples
--------

* YAML vs Python
* The story of JSON
* Whither garbage collector
* Metaprogramming
* LINQ vs. C#
* SQL vs. imperative
* DSL traps
* C++ templating language
* 


Subprinciples
-------------

These are principles which I think can partially be derived from this principle.

* Immutability vs. Mutability (side effects)
* Accidental turing completeness
* State isolation
* Lazy evaluation
* Principle of least privilege in protocol design - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege

Other people talking about the same principle

Commentary: While most of these discuss languages as if their power is uniform
and static I consider this to wrong. There are languages which have a diversity
of approaches and which have more powerful features and less powerful features.

* https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html#PLP (treats 'language power' as uniform across a programming language - although it can vary from feature to feature - e.g. functional vs. imperative).
