title: Clear naming
----

Naming is applied in various different contexts that apply to code:

* Variables
* Methods
* Classes
* Module names
* Project names

These principles apply to all of them.

There are typically three problems which lead to unclear naming:

* Ambiguous names
* Undefined names
* Misleading metaphors

Example principle conflicts:

* Write the least code possible - short names mean writing less code.
