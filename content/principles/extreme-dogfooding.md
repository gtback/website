title: Extreme dogfooding

All of the libraries on this website are the result of extreme [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food).

The idea behind this principle is that *not only* are the libraries used in anger in real life production code, but that also:

* The libraries' design (and even the idea itself) emerged from heavy refactoring rather than out of the blue.
* The libraries are built and trialed in real life situations to eliminate most of the bugs.
* New features are rarely, if ever, added because they seem like a cool idea.
* New features are added only if here is a clear and obvious need for it in a real life situation OR because it makes existing code significantly cleaner.
* API design is built around making the code that the library is used in cleaner.
