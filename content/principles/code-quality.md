title: Code quality principles
---

These are our set of code quality principles that should be adhered
to when initiating a pull request:

Coding standards (still TODO):

1. Write the least code possible
2. Loose coupling
3. Rule of least expressive power
4. Fail fast and fail clearly
5. One step tooling
6. High cohesion
7. Deterministic code
8. Code consistency
9. Disambiguated, clearly defined names and accurate metaphors.
